<p>I had a lot of difficulty with making my clock. I already had limited coding experience and I haven't had the slightest clue on where to begin. I knew I wanted to create a sun-inspired clock with dials that represented the hours/minutes of the day, but <em>again</em>, didn't know where to start.</p>
<p>What got me started was drawing everything out, not worrying about the coding aspect. I then wrote down what I can do; I can draw the sun and the inner circles and teh random dots (representing stars) in the background using a for loop. Then came the tricky part which was trying to get triangles all over the circle, which involved a scary amount of trig that I hoped to abandoned in high school. Alas.</p>
<p>It took hours to figure out what formulas I needed and how to translate that into p5js. I had to make a separate function to get 3 sets of coordinates for the triangles around the main circle. Using the two formulas x = h + r * cos(Theta) and y = k + r * sin(Theta). By plugging in the coordinates for the circle's center and tweaking the offset variable (how stubby the triangles are), the hard part was over! Hooray!</p>
